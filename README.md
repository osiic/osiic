# Hi, I'm Osiic 👋

Full Stack Web & Blockchain Developer.  
I build things for the web, experiment a lot, and slowly push myself deeper into the blockchain world.

Most of the time I’m either:
- working on client / freelance projects,
- building personal products that scratch my own itch,
- or sharing what I learn on social media to help people who are still confused about where to start with coding.

I also run a small web dev agency called **Ngetikin**, focused on helping small businesses get a decent website without overcomplicating everything.

## What I do

- **Full Stack Web Dev** – I design, build, and ship web apps end-to-end  
- **Smart Contract Dev** – I write smart contracts and explore how real products can live on-chain  
- **Content & Branding** – I document my journey, talk about code, and show how I build things in public  
- **Agency Builder** – I’m slowly turning Ngetikin from “side project” into a real service business

GitHub for me is a **lab**, not a museum.  
You’ll see experiments, half-finished ideas, weird branches, and a few projects that actually survive long enough to be deployed.

## How I think

I’m a **generalist with a sharp focus**:

- I enjoy understanding how things work from the bottom up:  
  Linux, LFS, how computers boot, how games run, why systems fail.
- I touch a lot of topics: web dev, backend, Linux, blockchain, sometimes AI and other tech rabbit holes.
- But in terms of **career direction**, I’m aiming at:
  - **Blockchain industry** as the main lane  
  - **Web development** as the core foundation I always return to

I like combining things:
turning low-level understanding + web dev + blockchain into one cohesive skillset that’s actually useful.

## What I build

- Full stack web apps (frontend, backend, deployment)
- Smart contracts for Web3 use cases
- Small internal tools and experiments that may or may not see the light of production

## Currently

Right now I’m:

- Building & refining **Ngetikin** as a small web dev agency  
- Learning more about **blockchain dev** beyond just “writing code that compiles”  
- Keeping my hands dirty with **Linux, tooling, and system-level stuff**  
- Open for:
  - freelance / project-based work  
  - junior / entry-level roles in Web or Blockchain development
