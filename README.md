# Hi, I'm Osiic 👋

Full Stack Web & Blockchain Developer.  
I build web apps, smart contracts, and small products while sharing the process online.

Most of my time goes to:
- client / freelance work (kalau ada),
- personal projects,
- and building a small web dev agency called **Ngetikin**.

---

## What I do

- Full stack web development (frontend + backend + deployment)
- Smart contract development for Web3 use cases
- Experimenting with Linux, tooling, and system-level stuff

I'm aiming my career at **blockchain**, with **web dev** as my core skill.
